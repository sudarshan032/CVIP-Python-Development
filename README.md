# CVIP-Python-Development


I am excited to share that I have successfully completed two Python projects during my recent journey as a developer. The first project is a fully functional Music Player Application, designed to play and manage various music files effortlessly. The second project is an intuitive Age Calculator utilizing Tkinter, which accurately computes age based on birthdates.


I want to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to Coder's Cave for granting me the opportunity to be part of their esteemed internship program. The experience I gained during my time at Coder's Cave was invaluable.
